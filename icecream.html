        <p style="color: darkcyan; font-size: large; width: 50%;">Ice cream is a mixture of milk, cream, sugar, and sometimes other ingredients that has been frozen into a soft, creamy delight using special techniques. Ice cream has been a popular treat for hundreds of years but has only become commonplace since the widespread use of refrigeration. The exploding popularity of ice cream has led to a number of ice-cream variations including frozen custard, frozen yogurt, and even non-dairy versions made with ingredients like coconut milk.</p>
